# Wifi Upload

Dead-simple Android app to allow you to upload a file from your browser to your phone, given
that they are connected to the same WiFi (which is often the case).

I built it because somehow the combination of my phone, my micro-USB cable, and Android
File Transfer likes to be unreliable in the most crucial times. Existing solutions
(e.g. [Portal], [Wifi File Transfer]) are either too sophisticated or too limited.
I just want to upload a file without all the bells and whistles.
